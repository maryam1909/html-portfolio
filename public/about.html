<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Maryam, a 19-year-old student currently navigating my way through the exciting journey of college life at SIT.
I'm in my second year, immersed in the fascinating world of learning and growth.</p>

<p>When I'm not buried in textbooks or attending lectures, 
you can find me exploring the vibrant streets of Pune City, my current home. 
From its buzzing cafes to hidden gems,
I love soaking in the unique energy and culture this city has to offer.</p>

<p>Passionate about expanding my horizons, I'm always up for new adventures and experiences.
Whether it's delving into a gripping novel, experimenting with new recipes, 
or engaging in thought-provoking conversations, I thrive on the beauty of life's diversity.</p>
